<h1>AI in Orthopaedics Hackathon Regression Model</h1>

<h3>
  The following is a competition solution for the British Orthopaedics Assocation's AI in Orthopaedics Hackathon solution. 
  The objective of the competition was to create an algorithm to classify orthopaedic patients into different classes (normal, herniated disc or spondylolisthesis) based on a given training dataset.
  In this solution, we  decided to implement a logistic regression AI model to classify the patients, and performed analysis on our results within the Jupyter notebook file.
  Further analysis can be seen in our documentation.
